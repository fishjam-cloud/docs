# Connecting

How to connect to Fishjam Cloud

## Getting URL and token

In order to connect, you need to retrieve URL (multimedia server address) and token (token that will authenticate you in your Room)

### Using sandbox app

Once you get your account on [Fishjam Cloud](https://fishjam.io), you will have access to Sandbox App.
This app comes with pre-configured test service called Room Manager. This is basically service that will
create Room, add your app as Room's Participant and return token required to use that Room.

To use that simply call `fetch`:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://fishjam.io/api/v1/connect/*YOUR_ID*/room-manager/*ROOM_NAME*/users/*USER_NAME*`
);

const { url, token } = await response.json();
```

## Connecting

In order to connect, you just need to call `connect` method with data from previous step:

```ts
import { connect } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-native-client";

await connect(url, token);
```

## Disconnecting

In order to close connection, you have to call `leaveRoom` method.
