Here you will find everything you need to start building your multimedia streaming applications using Fishjam Cloud.

## What is Fishjam Cloud?

Fishjam Cloud is a multimedia streaming toolkit that allows you to build real-time video and audio streaming applications using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).
We provide the infrastructure, media server and client SDKs so you can focus on building your apps.

**No WebRTC knowledge is required!**
