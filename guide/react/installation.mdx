# Installation

### 1. Install the package

Install `@fishjam-cloud/react-client` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @fishjam-cloud/react-client
```

### 2. Setup Fishjam context

Wrap your app in our `FishjamProvider` component.

```tsx
import { FishjamProvider } from "@fishjam-cloud/react-client";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <FishjamProvider>
      <App />
    </FishjamProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

:::tip

It's possible to have many independent Fishjam contexts in one app.  
Just render many `FishjamProvider` components and make sure they don't overlap.
